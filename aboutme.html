    <h2>

    I was born and raised in Fresno, California and lived there my whole life until I moved to Los Angeles in 2009 to attend UCLA. I graduated in the Spring of 2013 with a degree in Political Science and Applied Developmental Psychology. I am currently a paralegal with a real estate law firm in Culver City that specializes in bankruptcy and mortgage lender rights, and have worked with this law firm for three and a half years.

    <br>
    I started teaching myself web design and programming in early 2014, after deciding that law school was not the best path for me. I started with online resources such as Codeacademcy, Codeschool, General Assembly's Dash, etc. In the summer of 2014, I took BEWD with Jeff Dickies at General Assembly, which was my first introduction to the Ruby on Rails framework.
